Repository for backend server of Reaktor Summer trainee program
The backend server is running on: https://reaktor-backend-kjit.onrender.com (Works only when connecting from my frontend due to cors)

Frontend repo for this site found at: https://github.com/samikuikka/Reaktor-frontend

and the website for accessing the application: https://reaktor-frontend-l2w4.onrender.com
